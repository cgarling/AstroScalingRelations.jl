At low redshift, they use the stellar mass function of Li & White 2009 derived from SDSS DR7, ranging from stellar masses of 10^8.3 to 10^11.7 solar masses. This is supplemented by the low-mass stellar mass function from Baldry et al. 2008 for stellar masses between 10^7.4 to 10^8.3 solar masses. The high-redshift galaxy sample covers redshifts 0 < z < 4, using data from Perez-Gonzalez et al. 2008 for high-mass galaxies and Santini et al. 2012 for low-mass galaxies.
