# [AstroScalingRelations.jl Overview](@id guide)

This package implements astrophysical scaling relations like the stellar-mass-halo-mass function and stellar-mass-HI-mass relation. Methods are generally named after the paper they come from. Links to the relevant papers are included in the docstrings. See further documentation on the methods [here](@ref methods).
